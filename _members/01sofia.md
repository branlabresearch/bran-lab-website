I am also a member of the Executive Committee of the Network Science Society, a member of the council of the Complex Systems Society, the Vice President of the Women in Network Science Society and the former Chair of the advisory board of yrCSS.

Previously I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Informatics at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon and a Researcher at LASIGE, being the Co-Coordinator of the PhD Program in Complexity Sciences.
